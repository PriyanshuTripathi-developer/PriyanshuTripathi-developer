## 📌 What I'm Currently Working On

- 🔨 **Building:** A high-performance REST API with Django REST Framework, focusing on advanced features like rate-limiting, comprehensive documentation (drf-spectacular), and robust authentication flows.
- 📚 **Learning:** Advanced system design patterns, database optimization strategies, and diving deeper into asynchronous Python (asyncio, Celery).
- 🧪 **Exploring:** Microservices architecture and event-driven communication using message brokers like RabbitMQ.

## 🚀 Projects Highlight

My projects are focused on **real-world applicability, clean architecture, and thorough documentation**.

*   **E-commerce Backend API:** A fully-featured, production-ready REST API built with Django REST Framework. Implements JWT authentication, payment gateway integration, order processing, and an admin dashboard.
*   **Task Management System:** A full-stack application with a decoupled Django backend API and an interactive frontend. Demonstrates CRUD operations, user roles, and real-time updates.
*   **Data Analytics Dashboard:** A backend service that aggregates data from multiple sources, processes it, and serves it via a REST API to a dynamic frontend dashboard.

> **The common thread?** Solving tangible problems with a focus on performance, security, and developer experience.
