🧑‍💻 About Me
I'm a passionate backend-focused Full Stack Developer with a strong emphasis on building scalable, maintainable, and efficient systems. I thrive on transforming complex problems into elegant technical solutions that deliver real business value.

What drives me:

🏗️ Architecting robust backend systems that scale gracefully

🔧 Designing clean, intuitive APIs that serve both developers and users

🧩 Solving challenging problems with pragmatic, well-tested solutions

📚 Continuously evolving my craft through learning and experimentation

My philosophy: "Code is read more often than it's written. Write for the next developer who will maintain it – who might be you in six months."
